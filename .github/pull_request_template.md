# Versioning

<!-- Update the version if you want the PR to be merged fast. Currently it's a manual 3-steps process:
  * update version in `versioning.js` using semver principle. Just set the next patch (for fixes) or minor version (for new features)
  * for all changed files update hash (the part after `?`) in place where file is requested (usually it's `index.html`)
  * if the change can be really interesting for end-users, describe it inside the `showUpdateWindow()` function in `versioning.js` -->

- [ ] Version is updated
- [ ] Changed files hash is updated
